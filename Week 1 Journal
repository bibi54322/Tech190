Unity learning: 

Learned how to spawn objects, interact with Unity, and the basics of creating a game.

Personal game ideas:
I want to make a game that focuses on weapon-propelled movement. 
Inspiration will come from games like Quake, Team Fortress 2, and Assault Cube.
Quake and TF2 Rocket jumping is cool.
Assault Cube had a movement quirk where firing your weapon, such as a machine gun, would cause your character to move back due to the recoil.
  Also similar to the concept of Jetpack Joyride.

Leaning towards a roguelike genre, dodging enemies from off-screen as well as eliminating them. 
  Movement techniques will be important due to the player's walk speed and enemies being faster than the player's walk speed. 
  Enemies will have several movement patterns to keep gameplay interesting. 
  May add weakness to enemies to create a sense of satisfaction when using movement in order to shoot weak points. 
    Involves enemies having turn speeds.


What tension to add to gameplay?
  Low HP player? 
  High risk, high-reward?
    Stretch goals are bosses
  Ammo as a limited source?
  Reloading = no speed + enemies still on your screen = death?
  Could implement "upgrade system" that resets each game (Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain)

Tension is fun, but a rollercoaster that only goes down is not the most "fun". How to create "breathing space"?
  Slow mode ability
  An ability that involves I-frames
  Screen clear ultimate
  Level progression that allows players to choose when to go to the next area
